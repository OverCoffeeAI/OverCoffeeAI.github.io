        Waiting at the Window

      <p>I thought I'd share this in the form of writing. I thought I'd just pour everything out onto a sheet of paper for those who feel the same way I do. Everyone who's close to me I push away. I meet people who love me for myself, and appreciate me for my personality, yet I start to distance myself so I can't become attached. If I get attached, I don't want them to leave. And in one way or another, everyone leaves. People grow apart as time goes on, and I'll always be thinking about those good times we had. The times where moments felt like moments, and I'd go home with a smile on my face. I'd count the stars in the sky and think of all the times we'll be sharing soon.</p>

      <p>I'll think about us going to watch a sunset together, watching our favorite movie, heck, even our wedding, even after we just met. I can't do that to myself anymore. I can't let myself fall more than I already have, because it's too treacherous of a mountain to climb once more. If I scale the mountain called love, rocks will come flying, I'll lose my step, and begin to crash and tumble once more.</p>

      <p>But Jesus tells us to love one another, as we have loved him…</p>
      <p>And I'll continue to build walls, but I'll be standing at the window, waiting for you to knock.</p>
